# ( HTML ) 
* HTML pages are text documents.

* X HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.

* X Tags are often referred to as elements.

* X Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.

* X Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.

* X Attributes require a name and a value.

* X To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

# ( CSS )
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.

* X Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).

* X Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.

* X Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

* X CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.


# ( JavaScript language )
* A script is a series of instructions that the computer 
can follow in order to achieve a goal. 


* Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.

* Computers approach tasks in a different way than 
humans, so your instructions must let the computer 
solve the task prggrammatically. 


* To approach writing a script, break down your goal into 
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed 
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

## writing a script for a web page
* It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.

* The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages 
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).

* If you view the source code of the page in the browser, 
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, 
because the script works with the model of the web 
page that the browser has created.


## Function , Methods & Objects
* Functions allow you to group a set of related 
statements together that represent a single task.

* Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required 
to do their job) and may return a value. 


* An object is a series of variables and functions that 
represent something from the world around you.

* In an object, variables are known as properties of the 
object; functions are known as methods of the object. 


* Web browsers implement objects that represent both 
the browser window and the document loaded into the 
browser window. 

* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as 
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and 
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.

* Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data 
sets (and both can contain the other).

# ( jQuery )
* jQuery is a JavaScript file you include in your pages. 

* Once included, it makes it faster and easier to write 
cross-browser JavaScript, based on two steps: 
1. Using CSS-style selectors to collect one or more 
nodes from the DOM tree. 

2. Using jQuery's built-in methods to work with the 
elements in that selection. 

* jQuery's CSS-style selector syntax makes it easier to 
select elements to work with. It also has methods that 
make it easier to traverse the DOM. 

* jQuery makes it easier to handle events because the 
event methods work across all browsers. 

* jQuery offers methods that make it quick and simple to achieve a range of tasks that JavaScript programmers 
commonly need to perform.


# ( Ajax & JSON )
* Ajax refers to a group of technologies that allow you to update just one part of the page (rather than reload a whole page). 

* You can incorporate HTML, XML, or JSON data into 
your pages. (JSON is becoming increasingly popular.) 

* To load JSON from a different domain, you can use 
JSONP but only if the code is from a trusted source. 

* jQuery has methods that make it easier to use Ajax . 

* load() is the simplest way to load HTML into your 
pages and allows you to update just a part of the page 

* ajax () is more powerful and more complex. (Several 
shorthand methods are also offered.) 

* It is important to consider how the site will work if the user does not have JavaScript enabled, or if the page is not able to access the data from a server. 



# ( APls )

* APls are used in browsers, scripts, and by websites 
that share functionality with other programs or sites. 

* APls let you write code that will make a request, 
asking another program or script to do something. 

* APls also specify the format in which the response will be given (so that the response can be understood). 

* To use an API on your website, you will need to include ascript in the relevant web pages. 

* An APl's documentation will usually feature tables of 
objects, methods, and properties. 

* Providing you know how to create an object and call 
its methods, access its properties, and respond to its 
events, you should be able to learn any JavaScript API.
